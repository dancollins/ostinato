# Ostinato
Ostinato is an open-source, cross-platform network packet crafter/traffic
generator and analyzer with a friendly GUI. Craft and send packets of several
streams with different protocols at different rates. For more information,
visit the main project site [here](http://code.google.com/p/ostinato/).

This fork serves to contain changes we have made in the WAND networking
group to make the tool easier to use for us. It's not necessarily up to date,
and it's not necessarily stable.
